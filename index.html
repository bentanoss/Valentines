        <h1>Hi Angelina,</h1>
        <p>
            After all I did to plan to make you this Valentine's proposal, I felt like the hardest stage was writing this letter to really tell you how I feel. Even now, I'm still surprised at how lucky I am to have met you. I was never the curious and ambitious type. I always felt like I'd just be carefree and didn't care much about how I wanted to live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thinking about it now, the person who encouraged me to do more is you, from little things such as going out more with friends, traveling, and cooking for myself to bigger things like striving to achieve more academically, becoming VP of RoboSoc which helped me a bunch when applying for jobs, and actually using my brain to think about real issues rather than ignoring them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know we both have a lot of worries about uncertainties in life, being logical people, we tend to overthink more and that gives us anxiety. Despite all that, I'm glad I get to spend this stage of my life with you. I haven't been the most considerate and you haven't been the most patient, but I can't help but feel calm because I feel like as long as we know which steps to take in the present, we will be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, no matter what we've been through, I'm glad I met someone I could talk to and work things out with despite our long distance and other challenges. I hope I can give you the calmness you gave me, so here's to 2 years, and Happy Valentine's Day, I love you.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely, <br> Ben</p>
